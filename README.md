# Help Me üôè

**Summary:** I & my mom were attempted to killed earlier this year, authorities are treating us as accused, instead of victim. We are depressed & under so much mental pressure. Don't have any hopes of justice left from the system, personal & professional life is ruined. Looking upto social media with the hope of support which may lead to justice. Please support üôè.

I must speak before I just disappear(or get killed) one day suddenly or commit suicide under pressure of goons. I don't know the consequences in my professional life. But sharing  it, because when life itself will end, how will I prepend "professional" to it. 

People who know me personally, might have observed that from many months I have stopped contributing to the technical community, sorry for that.

I have already ran to authorities, wasted many weeks, sleeplessly, stopped doing that when my sleeping pills also stopped working. No one cares when there is political pressure created.

In India, in the state of UP, there are multilevels you can reach to get justice. First go to police, if that does not work then meet SP,and as a last hope raise an IGRS(complaint to Chief Minister of UP).
I have tried all of them already, police is better than media in distorting facts. Best of them handles IGRS complaints.

I & my mom who live in outskirt rural area of small city of Chitrakoot(Uttar Pradesh, India), were attempted to killed using iron rods in mid night of February month by the goons who travelled almost 300 kilemeters in winter to commit this crime.
A well planned crime, committed under political protection and sympathy of local police, all victim cards were played well to make situation in their favour before committing this crime.

When I started getting these threat last year, an application was already given to authorites, which they ignored. Now when crime is committed already, they didn't do proper investigation and in papers they are showing it like very minor incident. Even when there are enough medical proofs. Not mentioned how much damage is done, not inspecting the site properly, not showing place of incident improperly. And even afer all these proof and witnesses Police registred counter complaint, like I have committed the crime.

These photos are in no where in records of police. Visiting SP, raising IGRS, all is done. Please help me if anyone can, or suggest me a path otherwise my whole life is ruined.

Please support by spreading the words.
